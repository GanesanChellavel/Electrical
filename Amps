1 Amps = How  many Watts , Current ---> fllow of electrons,
1 Amps is 6.25X 10 is power of 10
1 Amps = columb of charge /sec


Amps = watts /volt     I=P/V
watts = Amps X volt    P=VXI    Only Dc supply 
Volt= watts/Amps       V=P/I



watts = Amps X volt  X P.F             Only single phase Ac supply
watts = Amps X volt  X P.F X  Root3    Only three phase Ac supply
